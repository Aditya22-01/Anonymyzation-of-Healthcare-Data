# Anonymyzation-of-Healthcare-Data

→ The system architecture suggests two types of blockchains: public main chains and private blockchains. Nevertheless, the patient's temporary ID is the only information stored on the public blockchain, making it impossible to monitor the patient's medical history. Furthermore, even if medical analyses are kept in clinic data centres, patients are given complete control over them and are regarded as the owners of those analyses under the architecture of our system. The original customer data, which is kept in the clinic's database, is what makes up the private blockchain. 
→ Preventing data loss in both moving and stationary data is the main goal of this technology. The idea is to stop the data at rest—that is, the data is stored—from being altered by any adversary because it is being saved in a nearly tamper-proof blockchain. 
→ Our goal is to anonymize our data in motion instead of trying to strengthen the security of each hospital's network, as that is beyond our purview. That is to say, any data that is transferred will be hashed so that, even if it is hacked, the attacker cannot misuse it. We can protect the moving data in our system from hackers in this way. 
→ The actual data and the data that is transmitted to the doctors are kept apart, and the data is divided into public and private chains. This will reduce the risk from data in motion to it because the genuine data, which contains all of the patient's information, won't be sent. 
→ All of the dangers associated with transferring data over a network will apply to the data being transferred to the doctors; however, hospital network security, not our system security, will determine how secure the doctors' data is. Beyond this, the proposed system will be tested against different attacks and vulnerabilities like SQL injection attacks, Denial of Service attacks, Weak Authentications attacks and so on to identify the capability of the system to withstand such attacks and preserve its security.
